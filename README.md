## 🔥 Summary

Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but show notable drawbacks:

1. **Blur and artifacts** when pushed to magnify beyond its training regime
2. **High computational costs and inefficiency** of retraining models when we want to magnify further

This brings us to the fundamental question: \
_How can we effectively utilize super-resolution models to explore much higher resolutions than they were originally trained for?_

We address this via **Chain-of-Zoom** 🔎, a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware prompts.
CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme resolutions without additional training.
Because visual cues diminish at high magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a prompt extractor VLM.
This prompt extractor can be fine-tuned through GRPO with a critic VLM to further align text guidance towards human preference.

## 🗓 ️News
- [Aug 2025] Additional code released.
- [Jun 2025] Check out the awesome 🤗 [Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/alexnasa/Chain-of-Zoom) by [@alexnasa](https://huggingface.co/alexnasa)! Thanks for the awesome work!
- [May 2025] Code and paper released.

## 🛠️ Setup
First, create your environment. We recommend using the following commands. 

```
git clone https://github.com/bryanswkim/Chain-of-Zoom.git
cd Chain-of-Zoom

conda create -n coz python=3.10
conda activate coz
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⏳ Models

|Models|Checkpoints|
|:---------|:--------|
|Stable Diffusion v3|[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium)
|Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct|[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct)

## ⚡ Quick Inference
You can quickly check the results of using **CoZ** with the following example:
```
python inference_coz.py \
  -i samples \
  -o inference_results/coz_vlmprompt \
  --rec_type recursive_multiscale \
  --prompt_type vlm \
  --lora_path ckpt/SR_LoRA/model_20001.pkl \
  --vae_path ckpt/SR_VAE/vae_encoder_20001.pt \
  --vlm_lora_path ckpt/VLM_LoRA/checkpoint-10000 \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers' \
  --ram_ft_path ckpt/DAPE/DAPE.pth \
  --ram_path ckpt/RAM/ram_swin_large_14m.pth \
  --save_prompts;
```
Which will give a result like below:

## 🔬 Efficient Memory
Using ```--efficient_memory``` allows **CoZ** to run on a single GPU with 24GB VRAM, but highly increases inference time due to offloading. \
We recommend using two GPUs.

## 🌄 Full Image Super-Resolution
Although our main focus is zooming into local areas, **CoZ** can be easily applied to super-resolution of full images. Try out the code below!

```
python inference_coz_full.py \
  -i samples \
  -o inference_results/coz_full \
  --rec_type recursive_multiscale \
  --prompt_type vlm \
  --lora_path ckpt/SR_LoRA/model_20001.pkl \
  --vae_path ckpt/SR_VAE/vae_encoder_20001.pt \
  --vlm_lora_path ckpt/VLM_LoRA/checkpoint-10000 \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers' \
  --ram_ft_path ckpt/DAPE/DAPE.pth \
  --ram_path ckpt/RAM/ram_swin_large_14m.pth;
```

## 🚆 Training the SR Backbone Model
**Chain-of-Zoom** is model-agnostic and can be used with *any* pretrained text-aware SR model. In this repository we leverage OSEDiff trained with Stable Diffusion 3 Medium as its backbone model. This requires some additional installations:

```
pip install wandb opencv-python basicsr==1.4.2

pip install --no-deps --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 xformers==0.0.28.post1
```

Please refer to the [OSEDiff](https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff) repository for training configurations (ex. preparing training data). Now train the SR backbone model:
```
bash scripts/train/train_osediff_sd3.sh
```
